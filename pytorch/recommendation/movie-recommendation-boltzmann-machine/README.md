# Collaborative recommendation systems with restricted boltzmann machine.

**Restricted Boltzmann machine** outperfom SVD on a large data and most other approches to recommendation systems don't seem to perform well on a lareg data > 100m data ppoints.

\*_Notes_:\* Boltzmann machine only have visible units (input layers) and hidden units {nodes in the hidden layers} without an output layers. Restricted means there is no interactions.
