# Artificial Intelligence in Summary

- Data Collection and Annotation
  - Getting data from various sources
  - Annotating/ Labelling it correctly
- Data Analysis
  - Data Exploration and Visualization for identifying missing values and all
- Feature Engineering:
  - Dealing with the identified missing values and preprocessing
- Feature Selection
  - Determining the right features of the data needed for the learning algorithm to perform well
- Model Development
  - developing several machine learning and deep learning architectures
  - Evaluation of the model accuracy using the right evaluation metrics.
- Deployment : Using the model in production environment such as
  - Deploying on a Mobile Applications: model compression to smaller footprint before usage
  - Deploying on Web Applications
  - Deploying on embedded devices
