## Medical Prognosis and prognostic models.

- Prognosis : predicting risk of a future event
  - Informing patients the risk if illness or survival with illness.
  - Taking the profile of a patient as an input and output a Risk score.
    - Profile includes: clinical history, Physical Examinations, labs and Imaging.

## prognosis: predicting Risk scores

    - Using the features of the data coefficient and the values in the patient data to make a risk score prediction.

- Risk of Liver disease
- Risk of heart disease

## Evaluating prognosis Models

- concordant :when a patient with the highest score happens to have the highest risk.
- Non Corcordant:when a patient with the lowest score happens to have the highest risk.
- permissible: outcomes are different.
- Risk Tie: Equal score but different survival chance.
- C Index
