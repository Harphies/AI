## The 3 Approaches to defining a Neural Network / Deep learning Implementation Architecture

- Modular Approach( sutibale for both pytorch and Keras implementation where we define sequential layers)
- Manually building weight and bias (a low level approach suitable to reproduce deep learning architecture on a paper you just read or to develop a customized layer)
- class based approach (Exdenting module class)
- Sequential approach inside a class based approach (Mixed approach)

  ## Popular Types of Layers in DNNs

  - Fully connected Layer (Dense)
    - Feed forward, fully connected
    - Multilayer perceptrons
  - Convolutional Layer
    - Feed forward, sparsely-connected / weight sharing
    - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
    - Typical used for Images
  - Recurrent Layer
    - Feedback
    - Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
    - Typically used for time-series/sequential data (e.g speech and language)
  - Attention Layer/Mechanism
    - Attention(matrix multiply) + feed forward, fully connected
    - Transformer

# Computer Vision tasks

- Image classification : The input to the problem is an image and the required output is simply a prediction of the class that Image belong to.

- object dectection : The input to the problem is an Image and the required output are bounding boxes surrounding the detected objects.(identification of many classes in an image)
- Instance segmentation: The input to the problem are images and the required output are pixels grouping that to each class
- Image Recognition
