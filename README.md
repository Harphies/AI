## The 3 Approaches to defining a Neural Network / Deeo learning Implementation Architecture

- Modular Approach( sutibale for both pytorch and Keras implementation where we define sequential layers)
- Manually building weight and bias (a low level approach suitable to reproduce deep learning architecture on a paper you just read or to develop a customized layer)
- Extending model class approach

  - Advanced Object Segmentation
- Natural Language Processing

  - Speech to text
  - Text to speec
  - Sentiment Analysis

  ## Popular Types of Layes in DNNs

  - Fully connected Layer
    - Feed forward, fully connected
    - Multilayer perceptrons
  - Convolutional Layer
    - Feed forward, sparsely-connected w/ weight sharing
    - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
    - Typical used for Images
  - Recurrent Layer
    - Feedback
    - Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
    - Typically used for time-series/sequential data (e.g speech and language)
  - Attention Layer/Mechanism
    - Attention(matrix multiply) + feed forward, fully connected
    - Transformer
